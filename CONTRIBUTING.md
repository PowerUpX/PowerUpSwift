# Contributing to PowerUpSwift

Thank you for considering contributing to this awesome library!

<br>

## You are very much welcome to implement

* Unit Tests

## Coding conventions
* It will be nice to integrate SwiftLint to have a consistent style across the codebase.

## Notes
* Please do not make Pull Requests for the Example folder (at least for now).

<br>

## Start
Fork, then clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/PowerUpSwift.git
```

## Commit
Make sure your commit messages are in present tense and are using American English (ex. *organize*, not *organise*) just so we can follow a standard.

This:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix bugs and update colors" 
```
Not this:
```bash
git commit -m "Fixed bugs and updated colours"
```

## Push to your Fork and make a pull request.
Please direct it to the `pull-request` branch instead of the `master` branch.
